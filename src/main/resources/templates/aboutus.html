		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>When we started in 2022, we set out to do things differently. We wanted to display all second-hand car options in one place, creating a simple alternative to the confusing sites that make buying your next dream car feel like hard work. We're proud that we have more than 10,000 car listings, across four different car classifed sites (that's quite a few!) to help users with their car dealings.</p>
		<p>Dedicated to making buying and selling second-hand cars as simple as possible, we assist each and every one to find the best deals across sites, listings and brands for their perfect car.</p>
		<p>But weâ€™re not stopping there.</p>
